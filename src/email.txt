Hi, {{firstName}},

How is your motivation letter coming along?

We understand that you may have other commitments and may not have time to complete your application at this time.
If there is anything we can do to help you with your application please respond to this email or get in touch with the community on https://gitter.im/CodeYourFuture-all/Applicants

We will be taking another intake in the not too distant future so if you would rather postpone your application please get in touch.

Regards,
CYF Team
